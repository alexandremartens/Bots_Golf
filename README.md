# Golf_Bots
Putting game project.

First of, to run the game as intended just run the DesktopLauncher under desktop/src/com.game.game.desktop/DesktopLauncher.
This starts the game and you can choose from a few options within the menu.

All the source code is in the core folder.

within src you can find, easily divided by folders, the code we currently use, the game class that was automatically generated,
and the old code (we kept all of our old code around for completion)

Inside OldEdits and NeuralNet there are several classes that also have a run option of their own.
